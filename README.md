## Exercise Tracker API

This is an API that can be used to store users, add exercise logs for that user, and return a log or list of exercises for a specific user.

* Created using Python and Flask
* Endpoints are resources.
  * api/v1/users accepts POST requests to create a user
  * api/v1/exercises accepts POST requests to log an exercise and GET to return a list of exercises
* Homepage with instructions was created with Bootstrap and some custom CSS

A live demo of the API can found at https://exercisetracker-api.herokuapp.com

You may have to try a couple times the first time you access the link as the app could be asleep.
